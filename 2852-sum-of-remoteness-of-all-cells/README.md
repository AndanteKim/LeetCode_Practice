<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-remoteness-of-all-cells/?envType=weekly-question&envId=2025-01-22">2852. Sum of Remoteness of All Cells</a></h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><p>You are given a <strong>0-indexed</strong> matrix <code>grid</code> of order <code>n * n</code>. Each cell in this matrix has a value <code>grid[i][j]</code>, which is either a <strong>positive</strong> integer or <code>-1</code> representing a blocked cell.</p>

<p>You can move from a non-blocked cell to any non-blocked cell that shares an edge.</p>

<p>For any cell <code>(i, j)</code>, we represent its <strong>remoteness</strong> as <code>R[i][j]</code> which is defined as the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li>If the cell <code>(i, j)</code> is a <strong>non-blocked</strong> cell, <code>R[i][j]</code> is the sum of the values <code>grid[x][y]</code> such that there is <strong>no path</strong> from the <strong>non-blocked</strong> cell <code>(x, y)</code> to the cell <code>(i, j)</code>.</li>
	<li>For blocked cells, <code>R[i][j] == 0</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return<em> the sum of </em><code>R[i][j]</code><em> over all cells.</em></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[-1,1,-1],[5,-1,4],[-1,3,-1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 39
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In the picture above, there are four grids. The top-left grid contains the initial values in the grid. Blocked cells are colored black, and other cells get their values as it is in the input. In the top-right grid, you can see the value of R[i][j] for all cells. So the answer would be the sum of them. That is: 0 + 12 + 0 + 8 + 0 + 9 + 0 + 10 + 0 = 39.
Let&#39;s jump on the bottom-left grid in the above picture and calculate R[0][1] (the target cell is colored green). We should sum up the value of cells that can&#39;t be reached by the cell (0, 1). These cells are colored yellow in this grid. So R[0][1] = 5 + 4 + 3 = 12.
Now let&#39;s jump on the bottom-right grid in the above picture and calculate R[1][2] (the target cell is colored green). We should sum up the value of cells that can&#39;t be reached by the cell (1, 2). These cells are colored yellow in this grid. So R[1][2] = 1 + 5 + 3 = 9.

<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[-1,3,4],[-1,-1,-1],[3,-1,-1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 13
<strong>Explanation:</strong> In the picture above, there are four grids. The top-left grid contains the initial values in the grid. Blocked cells are colored black, and other cells get their values as it is in the input. In the top-right grid, you can see the value of R[i][j] for all cells. So the answer would be the sum of them. That is: 3 + 3 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 7 + 0 + 0 = 13.
Let&#39;s jump on the bottom-left grid in the above picture and calculate R[0][2] (the target cell is colored green). We should sum up the value of cells that can&#39;t be reached by the cell (0, 2). This cell is colored yellow in this grid. So R[0][2] = 3.
Now let&#39;s jump on the bottom-right grid in the above picture and calculate R[2][0] (the target cell is colored green). We should sum up the value of cells that can&#39;t be reached by the cell (2, 0). These cells are colored yellow in this grid. So R[2][0] = 3 + 4 = 7.
</pre>

<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> grid = [[1]]
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> Since there are no other cells than (0, 0), R[0][0] is equal to 0. So the sum of R[i][j] over all cells would be 0.
